//! `tf_tree::open()` against real processes.
//!
//! This is the test the whole Phase 2 completion milestone exists for: **a
//! process that is not a child obtains the arena and reads the same transforms
//! as its creator.** Until `docs/decisions/0005` steps 1-5 landed, the only
//! transport was fd inheritance, so this could not be written at all.
//!
//! Real processes, not threads. The kernel is what makes the claims true —
//! that a `SIGKILL`ed participant's socket closes, that its lock byte is
//! released without its cooperation — and none of that is stageable in one
//! process. Children open the lock file and the socket **by path**: an
//! inherited descriptor shares the open file description, so every contention
//! assertion would pass vacuously.
